A Software Developer Learning Thai

I recently uprooted from the USA and moved to Thailand! It's been an incredible experience so far. One of the more fascinating aspects of it has been learning the Thai language. I've created a couple of basic tools to help myself learn. Developing the tools helps me learn new technologies, and the resulting product helps me learn the language!

- `Thai Characters`_ -- Simple flashcards to learn the characters and their low/middle/high class association. 
- `Thai Vocabulary Flashcards`_ -- Vocabulary flashcards. Interesting from a React/Material Design technical aspect.
- `Thai OCR Android App`_ -- Quick POC android app for doing Thai language OCR using the camera. It doesn't work very well right now, but I suspect a Tesseract_ upgrade might fix that.
