Quick Tip: Format Finder for .NET date strings

If you've written C# for any length of time, chances are you've become very familiar with the MSDN documentation pages about `Standard Date and Time Format Strings`_ and `Custom Date and Time Format Strings`_. Any time you need to format a ``DateTime``, those pages are invaluable.

I don't find myself reading those pages often enough to warrant memorizing the strings, but I do read them often enough that it's worth automating the lookup. So I wrote a simple webapp to do it.

I plan on skewing those curves by sharing this tool. So, here it is: `Format Finder`_.

Format Finder presents you with a very specific point in time: Monday, March 1st, 2009 at 8:04AM. You then provide the desired output of that date, and Format Finder will provide the formatting strings for you. For example, if you type in ``2009-03-01``, Format Finder will return a custom format string of ``yyyy-MM-dd`` along with a explanation of each part. Alternatively, if you type in ``3/01/2009``, Format Finder will return the standard format string of ``d``.

I hope other people find this as useful as I do. Let's skew that XKCD curve!
